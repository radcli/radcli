<p>The radcli library is a library for writing RADIUS Clients. The library's
approach is to allow writing RADIUS-aware application in less than 50 lines
of C code. It was based originally on freeradius-client and is source
compatible with it.</p>
<p>
For the development of the openconnect VPN server, I needed a simple library
to allow using radius for authentication and accounting without having to
understand the internals of radius. Such library was the freeradius-client library, but
it had too much legacy code centered around radlogin, a tool which is of no
significance today, was IPv4-only and had no releases for several years.
This library addresses these shortcomings, adds package management via
pkg-config, adds support for TLS and DTLS, provides documentation of the
API, and will include any new features for the task. It is provided as a
shared library in case it is useful to other projects as well, and is also made
source compatible with radiusclient-ng and freeradius-client.
