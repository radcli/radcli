# Specify which authentication comes first respectively which
# authentication is used. Possible values are "radius" and "local".
# If you specify "radius,local" then the RADIUS server is asked
# first then the local one. If only one keyword is specified,
# only this server is asked.

# Name of the nologin file which when it exists disables logins.

# RADIUS settings

# RADIUS server to use for authentication requests. This config
# item can appear more than one time. If multiple servers are
# defined they are tried in a round robin fashion if one server
# is not answering.
# Optionally, you can specify the port number on which the remote
# RADIUS server listens separated by a colon from the hostname.
# If no port is specified, /etc/services is consulted for the radius
# service. If this fails also a compiled in default is used.

# RADIUS server to use for accounting requests.
# All settings for authserver apply, too.

# between the RADIUS client and server.

# The length of time in seconds after we skip a nonresponsive RADIUS
# server for transaction requests. Server(s) being in the "dead" state
# are tried only after all other non-dead servers have been tried and
# failed or timed out. The deadtime interval starts when the server
# does not respond to an authentication/accounting request transmissions. 
# When the interval expires, the "dead" server would be re-tried again,
# and if it's still down then it will be considered "dead" for another
# such interval and so on. This option is no-op if there is only one
# server in the list. Set to 0 in order to disable the feature.
