# Protocol: Self-Verification

This protocol MUST be applied before finalizing any output artifact.
It defines a quality gate that prevents submission of unverified,
incomplete, or unsupported claims.

## When to Apply

Execute this protocol **after** generating your output but **before**
presenting it as final. Treat it as a pre-submission checklist.

## Rules

### 1. Sampling Verification

- Select a **coverage sample** of at least 3 specific claims, findings,
  or data points from your output. Include different claim types when
  present (for example: a file path, a code snippet, a conclusion, a
  severity assignment, or a remediation recommendation).
- For each sampled item, **re-verify** it against the source material:
  - Does the file path, line number, or location actually exist?
  - Does the code snippet match what is actually at that location?
  - Does the evidence actually support the conclusion stated?
- If any sampled item fails verification, **re-examine all items of
  the same type** before proceeding.
- For each sampled finding, apply **symmetric falsification**: attempt
  to disprove the finding with the same rigor you applied when
  falsifying candidate findings that you concluded were safe. Verify
  whether any upstream validation, API contract, or initialization
  invariant makes this safe; cite the specific call sites, checks, or
  invariants reviewed and explain why they do not neutralize the
  finding. If you have not verified that upstream validation does not
  apply, downgrade or remove the finding.

### 2. Citation Audit

Apply the epistemic labeling rules from the `anti-hallucination` protocol
(Rules 1–4: KNOWN/INFERRED/ASSUMED classification, refusal to fabricate,
uncertainty disclosure, source attribution). Scan the output for factual
claims that lack epistemic labels or source citations, and remediate each:
add the appropriate epistemic label (`[KNOWN]`, `[INFERRED]`, or
`[ASSUMPTION]`), add the citation, or remove the claim. **Zero uncited factual
claims** is the target.

### 3. Coverage Confirmation

- Review the task's scope (explicit and implicit requirements).
- Verify that every element of the requested scope is addressed:
  - Are there requirements, code paths, or areas that were asked about
    but not covered in the output?
  - If any areas were intentionally excluded, document why in a
    "Limitations" or "Coverage" section.
- Include the 4-field coverage statement defined in the
  `operational-constraints` protocol (Rule 9: Examined, Method,
  Excluded, Limitations).

### 4. Internal Consistency Check

- Verify that findings do not contradict each other.
- Verify that severity/risk ratings are consistent across findings
  of similar nature.
- Verify that the executive summary accurately reflects the body.
- Verify that remediation recommendations do not conflict with
  stated constraints.

### 5. Completeness Gate

Before finalizing, answer these questions explicitly (even if only
internally):

- [ ] Have I addressed the stated goal or success criteria?
- [ ] Are all deliverable artifacts present and well-formed?
- [ ] Does every claim have supporting evidence or an explicit label?
- [ ] Have I stated what I did NOT examine and why?
- [ ] Have I sampled and re-verified at least 3 specific data points?
- [ ] Is the output internally consistent?

If any answer is "no," address the gap before finalizing.

### 6. Determinism Check

When the output contains instructions, protocols, checklists, or
other directive text intended for LLM consumption, scan for language
that introduces non-deterministic interpretation:

- [ ] Are all instructions specific enough that two different LLMs
      would produce output with the same section headings, the same
      number of items per section (±20%), and the same classification
      labels?
- [ ] Are quantifiers concrete (specific counts or ranges, not
      "some" or "several")?
- [ ] Are evaluation criteria observable (not subjective adjectives
      like "good" or "appropriate")?
- [ ] Do all conditionals have explicit else/default branches?
- [ ] Are action verbs decomposed into specific sub-steps (not
      standalone "analyze" or "evaluate")?

If any answer is "no," tighten the language before finalizing. If the
vague language serves a deliberate purpose (e.g., allowing LLM
discretion in creative tasks), mark it with an inline comment
`<!-- intentionally flexible -->` and leave it unchanged. This check
applies to generated prompt text, instruction files, and protocol
content — not to narrative prose, user-facing explanations, or
creative output.

## radcli-Specific Extensions

### Agent-runnable verification (Rule 5 application)

Before declaring any security review or change "done", run what can be run
locally and report exactly what was and was not verified:

1. `clang-format --dry-run -Werror <file>` — run on every modified file under
   `src/` and `tests/`.
2. `ninja -C build` — the build must succeed with no new warnings.
3. `meson test -C build <relevant-test>` — check for `SKIP` vs `OK` in the
   output and report both.

### Most tests require root (Rule 3 application)

Meson reports skipped tests as `SKIP` (exit code 77), not as failures. A run
that shows no failures but many skips is not a passing run — it is a partial
run. **Never report "tests pass" when tests were skipped.** Instead report:
"Tests run locally: [list]. Skipped (require root): [list]. Full verification
requires CI."

### Human-judgment items (Rule 3 — Coverage Confirmation)

Always flag these explicitly as requiring maintainer review, even when your
own analysis found no issue:

- TLS/DTLS behavior (cipher selection, version negotiation, certificate handling)

State: "I have verified [list]. Skipped locally (require root): [list]. The
following require maintainer review: [list]." Do not omit any part.
