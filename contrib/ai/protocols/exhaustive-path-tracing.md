# Protocol: Exhaustive Path Tracing

Apply this protocol when performing deep code review where completeness
matters more than speed. This protocol is language-agnostic — adapt the
specific constructs (goto, exceptions, early returns) to the target language.

## Phase 1: Full-File Structural Map

For each file under review:

1. **Read the entire file**, not just search hits or snippets.
2. Build a **local map** documenting:
   - **Entry points**: exported functions, public methods, callbacks, ISRs
   - **Major helpers**: internal functions called by entry points
   - **Lock acquisition and release sites**: every lock/unlock, acquire/release
   - **Reference count acquire/release pairs**: AddRef/Release, ObRef/ObDeref,
     retain/release, or equivalent
   - **Key flags and state variables**: mode flags, status fields, state
     machine variables
   - **Cleanup blocks**: goto labels, finally blocks, defer statements,
     destructors, shared cleanup routines
   - **Error propagation**: return codes, exceptions, error callbacks

## Phase 2: High-Risk Function Identification

Identify functions that warrant deep path tracing based on these risk signals:

- Complex **goto structure** or deeply nested error handling
- **Many unlock or release points** (risk of missing one on a path)
- **Mixed success/error mutation** — function modifies state on the
  success path and must undo it on failure
- **User/kernel boundary handling** — functions that accept user-mode
  inputs, probe buffers, or transition privilege levels
- **Interlocked or lock-free state transitions** — CAS loops, atomic
  flag updates, speculative reads
- **Size, count, or offset arithmetic** — page counts, byte counts,
  allocation sizes, array indices derived from external input
- **Resource acquisition chains** — functions that acquire multiple
  resources that must be released in reverse order

Prioritize review effort on high-risk functions. Low-risk functions
(simple getters, pure computations, thin wrappers) receive lighter review.

## Phase 3: Per-Function Path Tracing

For each high-risk function, systematically trace:

### 3a. Success Path
- Walk the happy path from entry to return.
- Record every resource acquired, lock taken, state modified, and flag set.
- Verify all resources are released and state is consistent at return.

### 3b. Early-Return Paths
- Identify every `return`, `break`, `continue`, or exception throw that
  exits the function before the normal return point.
- For each early return, verify:
  - All locks acquired before this point are released.
  - All reference counts incremented before this point are decremented.
  - All state mutations before this point are rolled back or are
    consistent with the early-return semantics.

### 3c. Goto / Cleanup Targets
- For each goto target (or equivalent cleanup block):
  - Identify which entry points jump to it and what state they hold.
  - Verify the cleanup block handles the **union** of all possible
    acquired resources — not just the resources from one path.
  - Check for cleanup ordering (resources released in reverse
    acquisition order).

### 3d. Cleanup Symmetry Verification
- For every resource acquired (lock, refcount, allocation, handle):
  - Enumerate **all** code paths from acquisition to function exit.
  - Verify the resource is released on **every** path.
  - If release is delegated to a helper, read the helper to confirm.

### 3e. State Rollback on Partial Failure
- If the function performs a **sequence of mutations** (e.g., insert into
  list A, then update table B, then modify object C):
  - Verify that failure at step N rolls back steps 1..N-1.
  - Check for partial-mutation corruption: state left inconsistent if
    an intermediate step fails.

## Phase 4: Per-Finding Documentation

For each candidate bug that survives falsification:

1. **Cite exact line numbers** or ranges.
2. **Show the path to trigger it** — step-by-step control flow from
   entry point through the failing path.
3. **Name the object, lock, refcount, or state variable** involved.
4. **Explain why existing cleanup or retry logic does NOT make it safe.**
5. **State the concrete consequence** — crash, corruption, leak, escalation.
6. **Assign confidence**: Confirmed, High-confidence, or Needs-domain-check.

## Phase 5: Coverage Ledger

Before concluding review of a file, produce a coverage ledger:

```
Coverage ledger:
  Full file read: yes/no
  High-risk functions reviewed: <list>
  Lock/refcount/goto cleanup traced: yes/no
  Arithmetic sites reviewed: yes/no
  User/kernel boundary paths reviewed: yes/no (or N/A)
  Interlocked/concurrency paths reviewed: yes/no (or N/A)
```

If any item is "no", explain why and document it as a limitation.
Do not claim "no bugs found" without a completed coverage ledger.
