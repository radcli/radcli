* Version 1.3.1 (released 2023-01-29)
- Modified the variable names so that they do not conflict with
  generic and well known libraries.


* Version 1.3.0 (released 2020-11-11)
- Removed duplicate function definition from util.h (#53)
- Increased size of dictionary vendor and values to 32-bits from 16;
  this breaks the ABI from the previous release.
- Corrected a string termination issue in rc_avpair_tostr()
- Added functions to create dictionary without a file:
   - rc_dict_addattr
   - rc_dict_addval
   - rc_dict_addvend


* Version 1.2.12 (released 2020-09-11)
- rc_avpair_tostr: return error instead of crashing when time is
  invalid.
- Handle errno=ENETUNREACH and return NETUNREACH_RC.
- Do not use LOG_PERROR if not defined in syslog.h


* Version 1.2.11 (released 2018-09-14)
- rc_read_dictionary_from_buffer: introduced new function; this
  is required to load dictionary attributes from string buffer
  (#24)
- Added non-temporary IPv6 address support (#23). This enables
  radcli to use Global IPv6 address instead of temporary IPv6
  address as source address for packets sent out when IPv6 
  Privacy Extensions are enabled in system.


* Version 1.2.10 (released 2018-05-08)
- rc_send_server_ctx: addressed unaligned access issue on certain
  platforms (#27).
- Added Namespace support (#30). radcli now supports Namespaces on 
  Linux based systems.
- rc_apply_config: introduced new function; this is required to be
  called when no configuration file is set and parameters are set
  individually using calls to rc_add_config().


* Version 1.2.9 (released 2018-01-20)
- rc_avpair_gen: addressed issue that caused all attributes to be
  rejected if the last attribute in the message is a VSA with an unknown
  Vendor-ID or Type.


* Version 1.2.8 (released 2017-07-29)
- rc_random_vector will use gnutls_rnd() to obtain randomness if
  compiled with GnuTLS. This enables the library to not depend
  on specific kernel versions (there are versions of Linux kernel
  which do not provide calls for getentopy libc function).
- Fixed issue when several servers in radiusclient.conf are present.
  The issue caused only the first server to be contacted. Report
  and fix by Martin Belanger.
- No longer divide the timeout when across multiple servers.
  This restores the semantics of radiusclient-ng and freeradius-client
  in the 'radius_timeout' configuration contents. Report and
  fix by Martin Belanger.
- On REJECT copy back the AV-pair list. Prior to 1.2.8 radcli
  would copy the AV-pair list only in case of ACCEPT and CHALLENGE
  scenarios, and that caused issues with EAP. Patch by Aravind Prasad S.


* Version 1.2.7 (released 2016-12-18)
- Use monotonic time to calculate time differences. Based on
  patch by Marcel Patzlaff.
- Added basic EAP support. radcli will now automatically add
  a Message-Authenticator attribute to messages containing
  EAP-Message attributes. In addition, radcli will handle
  Access-Challenge response by returning a new
  CHALLENGE_RC result code. Patch by Martin Belanger.


* Version 1.2.6 (released 2016-04-04)
- Removed unused or deprecated options from configure.
- Added missing manpage rc_avpair_remove.3
- Deleted unused code.


* Version 1.2.5 (released 2015-11-28)
- Added TCP support (Aravind Prasad S)
- Corrected buffer overflow in rc_ipaddr_local()
- Added nas-ip config file option. That option allows to override
  the IP reported by NAS to the radius server.
- The NAS identifier set in the configuration file will override
  any identifier set by the application.
- The 'serv-auth-type' config option was renamed to 'serv-type'.
  That option also allows to configure for radius with TCP.


* Version 1.2.4 (released 2015-09-26)
- Use a portable name for radius accounting service (issue #4)


* Version 1.2.3 (released 2015-09-02)
- Re-added server fallback ability (Michael Richardson)
- Added 'clientdebug' option in the configuration file to allow
  easier debugging of the client (Michael Richardson)


* Version 1.2.2 (released 2015-08-21)
- Added versioned symbols


* Version 1.2.1 (released 2015-06-15)
- Removal of unused port-id-map file.
- Corrections in the link creation during install.
- Corrections in the types of the distributed dictionary.
- Added compatibility headers for radiusclient-ng.
- Added new API to access the context of a request.
- Eliminated the radius_deadtime option, and simplified the
  server setting option. Only a single auth or acct server
  can be specified.
- API and ABI modifications:
  - rc_aaa_ctx_free: New function
  - rc_aaa_ctx_get_secret: New function
  - rc_aaa_ctx_get_vector: New function
  - rc_aaa_ctx: New function


* Version 1.2.0 (released 2015-06-07)
- Initial version of the fork. That changes the name of the library to
  libradcli.so, and the header to radcli.h. A compatibility header with
  freeradius-client library is also installed.
- Adds support for TLS (RFC6614) and DTLS (RFC7360) without
  requiring any code changes for existing applications. It adds
  new configuration options: serv-auth-type, tls-ca-file,
  tls-key-file, tls-cert-file, tls-verify-hostname.
- Removed the requirement for legacy options to be present in the configuration
  file. That includes: auth_order, login_tries, login_timeout, nologin, issue,
  login_radius, seqfile
- Added higher level API to read values from VALUE_PAIR.
