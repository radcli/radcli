# The radcli library

## Introduction

The radcli library is a library for writing RADIUS Clients. The library's
approach is to allow writing RADIUS-aware application in less than 50 lines
of C code. It was based originally on freeradius-client and radiusclient-ng
and is source compatible with them.


## Background

For the development of the openconnect VPN server, I needed a simple library to
allow using radius for authentication and accounting without having to understand
the internals of radius. Such library was the freeradius-client library, but
was undocumented, had too much legacy code centered around radlogin, a tool 
which is of no significance today, was IPv4-only and had no releases for
several years, and zero tests.

This library addresses these shortcomings, adds a test suite and test driven
development, adds package management via pkg-config, adds support for TCP,
TLS and DTLS, provides documentation of the API, and will include any new
features for the task. It is provided as a shared library in case it is
useful to other projects as well, and is also made source compatible with
radiusclient-ng and freeradius-client.
