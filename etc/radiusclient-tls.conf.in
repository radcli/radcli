# optionally you can specify a the port number on which is remote
# RADIUS listens separated by a colon from the hostname. if
# no port is specified /etc/services is consulted of the radius

# For IPv6 addresses use the '[IPv6]:port' format, or

# TLS/DTLS settings

# Transport Protocol Support
# Available options - 'tcp', 'udp', 'tls' and 'dtls'.

# TLS and DTLS authentication can be used with PSK keys or X.509 certificate 
# authentication (see below).
serv-type   tls

# The CA certificate to be used to verify the server's certificate.
# Does not need to be set if we are using PSK (pre-shared keys).
tls-ca-file @pkgsysconfdir@/ca.pem

# Our certificate and key files. These identify this NAS to the
# radius servers. They don't need to be set if using PSK.

# Used for debugging purposed. It will disable hostname verification
